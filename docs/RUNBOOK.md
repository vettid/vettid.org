# vettid.org Operations Runbook

Everything you need to operate this environment, captured as of 2026-08-15.

## Deploys

```bash
npm run build && npm test && npm run check:site   # what CI runs
npx cdk diff                                      # preview before deploying
npm run deploy:site                               # web stack only (content changes)
npm run deploy:all                                # everything
```

- Content deploys take ~2–4 min: `BucketDeployment` uploads `website/` (HTML/txt/xml/json
  as `no-cache, must-revalidate`; assets 7-day cache) and invalidates CloudFront `/*`.
  Visitors see HTML changes immediately.
- Requires an active AWS SSO session (`aws sso login`); us-east-1 only.
- Stack order when deploying individually: DnsStack → SignupStack → VettidOrgStack
  (props flow left to right in `lib/app.ts`).

## Stacks

| Stack | Owns |
|---|---|
| `VettidOrgDnsStack` | Route53 zone for vettid.org + ProtonMail mail records |
| `VettidOrgStack` | Site bucket, CloudFront, cert, WAF telemetry, all logging |
| `VettidOrgSignupStack` | Mailing list: DynamoDB, Lambdas, HTTP API, SES domain identity |
| `VettidOrgPlaybooksStack` | Playbooks origin bucket (served at `/playbooks/*` by VettidOrgStack; content deployed from the vettid-playbooks repo) |
| `VettidDevRedirectStack` | The entire vettid.dev footprint: blanket 301 → vettid.org. Permanent. |
| `VettidOrgAuthStack` | Member + admin Cognito pools, clients, groups, admin hosted-UI domain, PIN pepper secret. Stateful. |
| `VettidOrgDataStack` | Account/admin DynamoDB tables (`vettid-org-*`) + terms PDF bucket. Stateful. |
| `VettidOrgAdminAccessStack` | Admin tailnet exit node (EC2 + EIP) and the WAF allowlists keyed to its IP (admin login + admin site). |
| `VettidOrgAdminApiStack` | Admin REST API at admin-api.vettid.org (docs/ADMIN-API.md): exit-node-IP resource policy + Cognito authorizer, 3 route-group Lambdas. |
| `VettidOrgAdminSiteStack` | Admin SPA at admin.vettid.org (`sites/admin`), behind the exit-node web ACL. |

## CDK conventions (new stacks)

Applies to everything added from the account/admin work onward
(docs/ACCOUNT-ADMIN-PLAN.md §3); the stacks above are grandfathered and keep
their construct IDs.

- **App wiring** lives in `lib/app.ts` (`bin/` only calls `buildApp`).
  Config — stage, domain, region, sender/admin email — comes from
  `lib/config.ts`; `-c stage=<name>` exists for a future staging account and
  defaults to `prod`. Physical names come from `resourceName()`
  (`vettid-org-<thing>`); hosts from `hostName()`.
- **Stateful vs stateless.** Pools and tables go in stateful stacks
  (Auth, Data) with `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`; APIs and sites go in stateless
  stacks that deploy freely.
- **No CloudFormation exports between them.** Producers call `publishRef()`,
  consumers `readRef()` (`lib/constructs/ssm-refs.ts`, params under
  `/vettid-org/<stage>/…`). Deploy the producer first.
- **Lambdas** are defined only through `ApiFunction` (Node 24, ARM64, esbuild,
  1-month log group) and served through `HttpRouteGroup`: one function per
  route *group* (`ANY /api/<group>/{proxy+}`), routing in the handler.
- **Static sites** use `StaticSite`: own host, strict CSP (`script-src 'self'`,
  no inline styles), same-origin `/api/*`, and `/config.json` generated at
  deploy time from CDK tokens.
- **Guardrails** (`test/app-guardrails.test.ts`, run in CI): ≤ 200 resources
  per stack, no `Fn::ImportValue` outside the grandfathered stacks, and every
  table/user pool retained.

## Admin access (Headscale exit node)

Admin (site, API, and the Cognito admin login) only answers requests from
the exit node's Elastic IP. To use admin: connect to the tailnet and select
the `vettid-org-admin-exit` exit node. Off → 403 everywhere.

**First-time setup** (and after replacing the instance):

1. On the Headscale server, create a pre-auth key:
   `headscale preauthkeys create --user <user> --expiration 1h`
2. Store it — run it yourself; the key should not pass through chat or the repo:
   `aws secretsmanager create-secret --name vettid-org-admin-access/headscale-preauth-key --secret-string <key>`
   (`put-secret-value` if it already exists).
3. Context `headscaleLoginServer` = the Headscale URL, kept **out of the repo**
   in your user-level `~/.cdk.json`:
   `{ "context": { "headscaleLoginServer": "https://<headscale host>" } }`.
   Without it the AdminAccess stack is skipped (with a synth warning).
   Deploy order: `VettidOrgAuthStack VettidOrgDataStack` → `VettidOrgAdminAccessStack`.
4. Approve the exit-node routes: `headscale nodes list-routes` /
   `headscale nodes approve-routes --identifier <id> --routes 0.0.0.0/0,::/0`
   (Headscale < 0.26: `headscale routes list` / `headscale routes enable -r <id>`;
   or an `autoApprovers.exitNode` entry in the Headscale policy).
5. The instance joins at first boot. If it didn't (key expired/missing):
   `aws ssm start-session --target <ExitNodeInstanceId>` then re-run the
   `tailscale up --login-server=... --authkey=... --advertise-exit-node` line.

The node patches itself (dnf-automatic) and has no SSH; admin it with SSM
Session Manager. Its AMI is pinned in `cdk.context.json` so a new Amazon
Linux release never replaces it on deploy. The EIP is retained even if the
stack is deleted.

**Adding an admin:** give them a Headscale node, then
`scripts/create-admin.sh <email>` (run twice: first sends SES verification,
second creates the Cognito user, which emails a temporary password). First
sign-in sets a password and enrolls TOTP. **Removing an admin:** delete
their Headscale node *and* disable/delete the Cognito user.

## DNS

- Route53 is authoritative for **vettid.org** and **vettid.dev**; the registrar
  (Hover) only points nameservers.
- ProtonMail records (MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC) live in the DnsStack — change mail
  config in code, not the console.
- ACM certs auto-validate through the zones; renewals are hands-off.

## Mailing list

- Flow: `POST /api/subscribe` → SES `CreateEmailIdentity` (SES's verification
  email IS the double opt-in) → pending row in `vettid-org-mailing-list` →
  15-min sweep confirms verified addresses. Already-verified addresses confirm
  instantly.
- Every confirmation emails **admin@vettid.org** from `no-reply@vettid.org`
  (SES domain identity, DKIM in the zone).
- Export subscribers:
  `aws dynamodb scan --table-name vettid-org-mailing-list --output json`
- **SES is in sandbox**: fine for the opt-in flow (verified recipients only by
  design), but bulk sending to the list requires production access — request it
  in the SES console before the first newsletter.

## Logging & analysis

- CloudFront v2 JSON logs → `s3://vettid-org-access-logs/AWSLogs/<acct>/CloudFront/cloudfront-v2/…`
  (90-day retention) → Athena table `vettid_logs.cloudfront_logs_v2`
  (partition projection; pass `distributionid` as injected partition).
- Legacy TSV logs → `vettid.org-logs` (30-day) → `vettid_logs.cloudfront_logs`.
- WAF telemetry (JA3/JA4 fingerprints, ordered headers, cookie/auth redacted) →
  CloudWatch group `aws-waf-logs-vettid-org` (90-day). Join to CloudFront logs
  on request ID.
- See `docs/logs-analysis.md` for Athena queries; the capture spec is
  `~/VettID/vettid-org-logging-spec.md`.

## Website conventions

- No build step; plain HTML/CSS/JS. Zero inline styles; zero external resources
  (enforced by CSP `default-src 'none'` + self-only sources).
- Design tokens live in `website/assets/site.css` ("Night Watch" system).
- `npm run check:site` enforces: tag/brace balance, no inline styles, no
  vettid.dev references, no broken internal links.
- The CloudFront function handles clean URLs, `/security.txt` → `.well-known`,
  the hostile-path 403 layer (percent-decode normalized, `/.well-known/*`
  exempt), and www→apex 301s.

## Dates to watch

- **security.txt expires 2027-05-25** — bump `Expires:` in
  `website/.well-known/security.txt` before then (and re-sign if it ever gets
  PGP-signed).
- KMS keys from the vettid.dev teardown finish their 7-day deletion window
  ~2026-08-20; after that the old vault data in the archive is the only copy.

## The vettid.dev archive

`~/VettID/data/vettid-dev-archive-20260813/` — all DynamoDB tables (including
the old waitlist and registrations), Cognito users, and every S3 bucket
(including 1.4GB of encrypted vault data). **This is the only copy** — keep a
durable backup.

## Expected monthly cost

~$7–8: WAF telemetry (~$5, intentional), two Route53 zones ($1), CloudFront/
Lambda/DynamoDB/S3 in pennies at current traffic.
