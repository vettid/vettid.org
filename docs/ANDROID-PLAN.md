# Android app plan (v1)

The first mobile client for the new vault. A fresh rewrite in the
existing `vettid/vettid-android` repository, with a deliberately smaller
surface than the vettid.dev app and a layout modelled on Proton Mail.

## 1. Starting point

- **Existing app** (`vettid-android`): about 158k lines of Kotlin in one
  Gradle module (Compose + Material3, Hilt, EncryptedSharedPreferences,
  Retrofit, jnats). NATS is used directly by about 90 files; a 4.4k-line
  client object owns transport, crypto and ~30 event handlers; navigation is
  one 2.9k-line file; several flows exist twice (enrollment, secrets, calls,
  credential stores); ~19k lines are dead B2C service code; all strings are
  hard-coded. Refactoring it in place would carry that complexity forward.
- **Worth carrying over** (with their tests): hardware key attestation
  (`HardwareAttestationManager`), Nitro attestation verification and PCR
  handling (`NitroAttestationVerifier`, `PcrConfigManager`), crypto and
  security helpers (`CryptoManager` minus the old UTK code, `SecureMemory`,
  `RuntimeProtection`, `UnlockRateLimiter`), the WebRTC layer and frame
  encryption (`WebRTCClient`, `CallFrameCryptor`) for when calls arrive,
  and a few components (QR scanner).
- **The vault side is defined**: VAULT-MESSAGING lists every message type
  the app sends and receives, with body schemas, roles and error codes, and
  vettid-vault ships test vectors and a Go reference client (`client/`,
  `vaultctl`).

## 2. Decisions (owner, 2026-10-03)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | **Fresh rewrite in `vettid-android`**, same package name `com.vettid.app` (keeps the Play listing and signing key). The old code is preserved on a branch/tag and removed from `main`. |
| D2 | **Proton Mail layout, VettID brand**: dark navy surfaces and Proton's structure; VettID gold (`#FFC125`, owner 2026-10-04, §3) as the single accent; the rook logo stays gold with a black keyhole; a light theme as on the website. |
| D3 | **v1 scope**: enrollment, unlock, Protean Credential, settings (always), plus **connections + messaging** and **items** (data, secret and critical items per VAULT-ITEMS; originally "secrets + critical secrets"). Calls, desktop/agent pairing and LEASH, wallet, location and presence come later. |
| D4 | **Minimum Android 12 (API 31)**; target the current API level. |
| D5 | **Message search later** (not in v1). |
| D6 | **Biometric app lock in v1**: opening the app (and returning to it after a timeout) can require a biometric or device credential via BiometricPrompt (class 3), gating a Keystore key that unlocks the app's local data. It is a convenience layer only: it never replaces the vault PIN (unlocking the vault) or the credential password (critical actions). |

## 3. Design language (from Proton Mail)

Reference screenshots are kept privately (they show a real mailbox); the
patterns:

- **Top bar**: menu button, screen title, search, avatar (initial tile).
- **Navigation drawer** as the main navigation (no bottom tabs): primary
  destinations, then a "create" group, then Settings / Help, version at the
  bottom.
- **List rows**: rounded-square initial tile, two lines (name, preview),
  date and a trailing action icon; generous spacing.
- **Empty states**: one illustration, a title and one line.
- **Floating controls**: a filter chip bottom-left (e.g. Unread), a primary
  action button bottom-right (compose / add).
- **Detail screens**: back arrow, centred title, content in a card, a
  floating pill of actions at the bottom.
- **Settings**: grouped rounded cards, rows with icon + label + chevron,
  section headers.
- **Avatar sheet**: a bottom sheet with the account and its options.
- **VettID brand** (owner, 2026-10-04): gold `#FFC125` (the website's
  `--gold`) as the single accent, `--gold-ink-light` `#7F640A` for gold
  text and icons on light surfaces; navy surfaces from the website tokens;
  Plus Jakarta Sans for headings and Inter for body, as on the website;
  Material Icons Outlined. Connection tiles are one indigo, favourite
  connections teal, the member's own avatar gold.

## 4. Screens (v1)

**Drawer**: Messages · Connections · Approvals (badge) · Items ·
Credential · Settings · Help — later: Calls, Devices & agents, Shared
actions & introductions, Wallet, Location. A "create" group (Proton's
Create folder / label) is added once its screens exist: **Invite a
connection** and **New item** (A4/A5); until then the A0 shell shows only
the destinations.

| Screen | Proton analogue | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Messages | Inbox | Conversations by connection; Unread chip; compose button |
| Conversation | Message detail | Bubbles in a card list; pill actions (reply, more) |
| Connections | Contacts | Initial tiles, status (pending / active / stale / blocked); a star marks favourites (the owner's `favorite` flag, `connection.update`), whose tiles are teal; add = invite (QR or link) / scan |
| Connection detail | — | Profile shared with you, safety code (SAS), authenticate, alias/notes, block/remove |
| Approvals | — (VettID-specific) | Pending connection requests, grant requests, critical-item uses, share-rule decisions; approve/deny; critical items need the credential password |
| Items | Folder list | Items per VAULT-ITEMS: name, category, typed fields, tags, sensitivity (data / secret / critical); filter by tag; add/edit from templates; share rules by tag (default: ask for each new item). Critical items live in the Protean Credential and are never shared by a rule |
| Credential | — | Critical items inside the Protean Credential; unlock window; password change; the vault-held credential copy on/off |
| Settings | Settings | Vault (status, release, lock, PIN); Security (credential, recovery, attestation info, biometric app lock and timeout, the owner-check interval 1–24 h); Privacy; App (theme, notifications and push path) |
| Owner check | — (VettID-specific) | One screen: PIN and credential password together (VAULT-MESSAGING §3.6.5); also the "vault held" screen with the waiting counts and the lock action |
| Avatar sheet | Account sheet | Vault status, lock vault, open account portal, sign out of this device |
| Onboarding | Sign-in flow | Membership check → enroll vault (PIN, credential password) → first connection guide |

Every list has an empty state; every destructive action has a confirmation;
every critical action asks for the credential password.

There is no backup or export of vault data out of the service (owner
decision, 2026-10-03); no screen offers one.

## 5. Architecture

Multi-module Gradle, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose + Material3, Hilt, coroutines
and Flow, Room (encrypted with a Keystore-held key) for local caches,
DataStore for preferences, OkHttp for HTTP, strings in resources from day
one (translation-ready), accessibility labels required in review.

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `:core:crypto` | Suite 2 (HPKE MLKEM768X25519 / HKDF-SHA256 / ChaCha20-Poly1305), XChaCha20 sessions, Ed25519, Argon2id; envelope v2; handshake and epochs; credential UTK/reply-key sealing. **Must pass the vettid-vault test vectors byte for byte.** |
| `:core:keystore` | Android Keystore keys (device identity, relay key wrapping, device attestation key with StrongBox/TEE, the biometric-gated app-data key) |
| `:core:attestation` | Ported Nitro attestation + PCR manifest verification; Android key attestation for enrollment/unlock (§11.7) |
| `:core:relay` | Relay client (RELAY-PROTOCOL 0.6): register, signed requests, tokens, deposit, collect (long-poll / WebSocket), ack, claims, blobs |
| `:core:altchan` | Member-API alternate channel: descriptors, sealed enroll/unlock/lock, result polling, release-update approval |
| `:core:vault` | Typed vault client: one function per §10 type, sessions with the vault, dedupe, outbox, sync events → repositories |
| `:core:data` | Repositories and Room caches per feature |
| `:core:ui` | Theme (navy + gold, light/dark), components (top bar, drawer, list row, empty state, pill bar, settings cards, sheets) |
| `:feature:*` | onboarding, messages, connections, approvals, items, credential, settings |
| `:app` | Navigation (type-safe routes), DI wiring, notifications |

Rules: features depend only on `:core:*`; no feature touches transport or
crypto directly; one ViewModel per screen with immutable UI state.

## 6. Phases

| Phase | Contents | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| A0 | Spec + this plan approved; old code tagged and moved off `main`; empty multi-module skeleton, CI (build, unit tests, lint, detekt), theme and component gallery screen | CI green; component gallery matches the design language on a phone |
| A1 | `:core:crypto` + vectors; `:core:keystore`; `:core:attestation` port | All vettid-vault vectors pass (incl. MLKEM768X25519 HPKE interop) |
| A2 | `:core:relay` + `:core:altchan` + `:core:vault` against a local dev stack (vettid-vault integration stack: relay + parent + dev enclave + member-API stand-in) | Instrumented test enrolls, unlocks, exchanges a message with a `vaultctl` peer |
| A3 | Onboarding, unlock, credential, settings screens, biometric app lock | Fresh install → enrolled vault with credential on a real phone (dev stack) |
| A4 | Connections, messages, approvals | Invite/QR connect, SAS, messages both ways, approvals |
| A5 | Items (data, secret, critical), tags, share rules, grants and critical-item approvals | Flows against the dev stack and a second vault |
| A6 | Hardening and polish: accessibility pass, notifications, offline behaviour, error states, Play pre-launch report | Internal testing track build |

Calls, devices/agents/LEASH, wallet, location and presence follow v1 in
that order, each as its own phase.

**Owner check** (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.13.0 §3.6, owner decisions of
2026-10-05). The vault holds when the member has not given the PIN and
the credential password together for 24 h (or the member's shorter
interval). Follow-ups, in A3 unless noted:

1. `:core:vault`: `vault.owner_check` (UTK-sealed `{pin, password}` with
   the blob; the new blob is stored and acked like any credential
   response), `vault.held`, `owner_check` in `vault.status`,
   `owner_check_required`, `vault.locking{reason: "owner_check"}`,
   `sync.event{owner_check}`, the `owner_check.*` feed kinds.
2. **One check screen**: PIN and password on one screen, sent together;
   both zeroized after the answer. Shows which entry was wrong, the
   checks left before the lock (10 − `failures`) and a running backoff.
3. **When to ask**: at the first app open or return to the foreground
   after the deadline, before any vault screen; never over an action in
   progress. A refused request keeps its input (drafts stay drafts) and
   the prompt follows when the member leaves the screen.
4. **Held screen**: no cached vault content (messages, items,
   connections, feed) while held; only the check, the `vault.held`
   counts ("3 new messages waiting") and the lock action. After the
   check, catch up (`sync.since`, `feed.list`, `message.list`).
5. **Early warning** (A6, with notifications): from 1 h before the
   deadline, a banner and a local notification with "check now".
6. **Locked and past the deadline**: one screen for PIN and password;
   unlock, read `vault.status`, then send the check without asking again.
7. **Settings**: the interval (1–24 h); shortening may hold the vault at
   once, so the app offers a check with the change.
8. **Lock after ten failures**: show the locked state and the urgent
   feed item after the next unlock.
9. Tests: an injectable clock in the dev stack (vettid-vault) to drive a
   vault past its deadline; instrumented tests for the held screen, the
   check, a wrong PIN, a wrong password and the ten-failure lock.

**Location phase notes** (from vettid-dev `docs/plans/location-sharing-ux.md`,
input for when the location batch is specified in VAULT-MESSAGING): show a
shared location in three layers: an event when a connection **starts
sharing** with you (a feed item, once), a **glance** on the connection's row
(last-seen place and age), and **detail** on the connection screen (map with
accuracy and time). The viewer shows the latest location the vault cached
for that connection rather than tracking live, and offers a **request
location** action that asks the connection to share once. The vault
schema for the cache and the request verb belong to the location batch.

## 7. Dependencies on other work

- **Running vault**: v1 development uses the local dev stack; real devices
  need the V5 deployment (release pipeline, member API vault routes
  deployed, enrollment/recovery portal pages).
- **Push** (owner decision, 2026-10-03: both paths): FCM when Google Play
  services are present, **UnifiedPush** for phones without them (for
  example GrapheneOS), and, with neither, a foreground service that keeps
  the relay connection, or periodic polling (PUSH-GATEWAY 0.2.0 §11). The
  member can pick the path in notification settings. Until the gateway is
  deployed (FCM needs credentials), v1 collects while the app is open and
  through the foreground-service path.
- **Membership**: enrollment requires an account.vettid.org member who has
  accepted the current terms (MEMBER-API).

## 8. Risks

1. **Post-quantum crypto on Android**: Android has no platform ML-KEM; the
   suite needs BouncyCastle (or another library) supporting HPKE with
   MLKEM768X25519 (codepoint 0x647a) — the cross-implementation vectors are
   an open follow-up in VAULT-MESSAGING §15. Verify early (A1); fall back to
   a small audited implementation only if no library fits.
2. **Scope creep from the old app**: v1 is deliberately small; resist
   porting screens without a v1 need.
3. **Device attestation in the field**: key attestation varies by vendor;
   test on several devices before release.
4. **Background delivery without push**: until the gateway exists,
   messages arrive while the app is open or through the foreground
   service; set expectations in the UI.
5. **GrapheneOS and device attestation** (resolved): GrapheneOS reports
   its own verified-boot key (`SelfSigned`); VAULT-MESSAGING 0.9.0 §11.7
   accepts it when the key is one of the pinned GrapheneOS fingerprints.
   Staging accepted GrapheneOS attestation on real phones on 2026-10-05
   (Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, verified boot yellow / `SelfSigned`).

## 9. Open questions

None at this time (min SDK, search and biometrics decided 2026-10-03).
