title: ANDROID-PLAN
status: draft
version: 0.1.15
date: 2026-10-08
changelog:
  - 0.1.15: owner feedback of 2026-10-08: value-first item fields (one input
    captioned by the field's label, its type as a hint; a ⋯ menu to rename,
    change an unsaved field's type, move or remove; the label asked for when
    adding), a short explanation of tags under Tags, and member-defined
    categories ("New category…" derives the §10.7 identifier from a typed
    name, custom ones shown humanized and offered in the picker and the
    Vault filter) (§4)
  - 0.1.14: owner, 2026-10-08: the profile photo's review step shows
    the shot in a circular frame to crop/zoom (pinch, drag, zoom buttons
    or slider, Reset); "Use photo" keeps the square under the circle
  - 0.1.13: owner decisions of 2026-10-08: the connection detail is
    simpler. No safety code (SAS) there: it protects the moment of
    connecting only and stays on the invite and request screens; the
    vault key fingerprint is the lasting identity check. No alias or
    note: the app neither shows nor sets them (no `connection.update`
    alias or note), and a connection is always titled "First Last",
    never by an alias; aliases and notes a vault already holds stay
    there, unshown. The detail's action bar loses edit and block;
    remove stays, and an incoming request can still be blocked (§4)
  - 0.1.12: owner feedback of 2026-10-08, from testing the S5 staging
    app: **Lock vault** is the first entry of the avatar sheet, right
    under the name and email (it was at the bottom, cut off on a phone),
    and the sheet scrolls so every entry is reachable; the profile photo
    is **camera only**: taken with the app's own camera screen (CameraX,
    the front camera first with a switch to the rear one, "Retake" and
    "Use photo"), never selected from the gallery (no Photo Picker) and
    never taken by another camera app (no system camera intent), kept
    in memory only, never saved to the gallery or shared storage, then
    cropped, scaled and re-encoded as before (≤ 65,536 bytes, no EXIF);
    the shared profile's glyph is Material Icons Outlined `Badge` (an ID
    card), on its screen and on the rows that open it (§3, §4)
  - 0.1.11: owner decisions of 2026-10-07, from testing the staging
    app (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.20.0 §15 item 28, MEMBER-API 2.3.0): the
    avatar sheet and a Settings account card show the member's first
    and last name and full email address (the snapshot's `email`, shown
    only to the member); the drawer drops "Credential" (Settings →
    Security → Credential) and "Invite a connection" (the floating
    action button invites on Connections and starts a new message on
    Messages; the drawer's planned "create" group is dropped, as the
    button creates everywhere); the Items section is called **"Vault"** in the interface
    ("items" stays the technical term); a new drawer entry **"History"**:
    the audit log, searched by the vault (`q`), filtered by category,
    connection and date, with infinite scroll and an entry detail,
    read-only (§3, §4, §5, §6)
  - 0.1.10: connections are titled with the account's first and last
    name from the profile's core, the display name secondary, a
    placeholder only until the first profile arrives, and the
    identity-key fingerprint in the details, never called verified; the
    member changes their own names only here, in the avatar sheet, with
    the PIN and the credential password (`account.name.set`, at most
    once every 30 days) (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.18.0 §10.8, MEMBER-API
    2.2.0) (§4)
  - 0.1.9: a phone set up by a direct transfer stores the member's
    `user_guid` from the vault's `device.paired` and unlocks with it,
    and warns when an older vault release sent none; the owner check's
    backoff countdown comes from `retry_after` (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.17.0)
    (§4, §6)
  - 0.1.8: the pending-deletion banner cancels with the `deletion_id`
    from `GET /api/vault/status` (MEMBER-API 2.1.1, VAULT-MESSAGING
    0.16.1) (§4)
  - 0.1.7: no recovery with the credential backup off (VAULT-MESSAGING
    0.16.0, owner decisions of 2026-10-06): the backup-off warning, the
    recovery screens without the backup-off path, `no_backup`, and
    "delete and start over" with a new setup code (§4)
  - 0.1.6: the owner check's message type is `vault.owner-check`
    (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.15.2: §5.3's type grammar has no underscore); the
    settings keys, `owner_check_required` and the `owner_check` sync,
    lock-reason and feed kinds keep their spelling
  - 0.1.5: the app never signs in (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.15.0 §11.12–§11.13,
    MEMBER-API 2.0.0; ENROLLMENT-CODES.md): onboarding by setup code, the
    avatar sheet's account view from the vault (§4), `:core:altchan`
    (§5), membership (§7)
  - 0.1.4: the daily owner check (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.13.0 §3.6, owner
    decisions of 2026-10-05 and 2026-10-06): follow-ups for A3 and A6
    (§6), the Settings and owner-check rows (§4), the hold switch
  - 0.1.3 (editorial): D2 gold #FFC125 as in §3; GrapheneOS risk closed
    (staging accepted GrapheneOS attestation on 2026-10-05); current
    VAULT-MESSAGING and RELAY-PROTOCOL versions
  - 0.1.2: Secrets → Items per VAULT-ITEMS (drawer, screens, modules, A5);
    favourite connections; the drawer "create" group (§4); brand gold
    #FFC125 and the website fonts (§3), owner decisions of 2026-10-04
  - 0.1.1: owner decisions of 2026-10-03: push on both paths (FCM and
    UnifiedPush, plus a foreground-service path without push, §7); no
    backup or export of vault data (§4); location viewer notes for the
    location phase (§6)

# Android app plan (v1)

The first mobile client for the new vault. A fresh rewrite in the
existing `vettid/vettid-android` repository, with a deliberately smaller
surface than the vettid.dev app and a layout modelled on Proton Mail.

## 1. Starting point

- **Existing app** (`vettid-android`): about 158k lines of Kotlin in one
  Gradle module (Compose + Material3, Hilt, EncryptedSharedPreferences,
  Retrofit, jnats). NATS is used directly by about 90 files; a 4.4k-line
  client object owns transport, crypto and ~30 event handlers; navigation is
  one 2.9k-line file; several flows exist twice (enrollment, secrets, calls,
  credential stores); ~19k lines are dead B2C service code; all strings are
  hard-coded. Refactoring it in place would carry that complexity forward.
- **Worth carrying over** (with their tests): hardware key attestation
  (`HardwareAttestationManager`), Nitro attestation verification and PCR
  handling (`NitroAttestationVerifier`, `PcrConfigManager`), crypto and
  security helpers (`CryptoManager` minus the old UTK code, `SecureMemory`,
  `RuntimeProtection`, `UnlockRateLimiter`), the WebRTC layer and frame
  encryption (`WebRTCClient`, `CallFrameCryptor`) for when calls arrive,
  and a few components (QR scanner).
- **The vault side is defined**: VAULT-MESSAGING lists every message type
  the app sends and receives, with body schemas, roles and error codes, and
  vettid-vault ships test vectors and a Go reference client (`client/`,
  `vaultctl`).

## 2. Decisions (owner, 2026-10-03)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | **Fresh rewrite in `vettid-android`**, same package name `com.vettid.app` (keeps the Play listing and signing key). The old code is preserved on a branch/tag and removed from `main`. |
| D2 | **Proton Mail layout, VettID brand**: dark navy surfaces and Proton's structure; VettID gold (`#FFC125`, owner 2026-10-04, §3) as the single accent; the rook logo stays gold with a black keyhole; a light theme as on the website. |
| D3 | **v1 scope**: enrollment, unlock, Protean Credential, settings (always), plus **connections + messaging** and **items** (data, secret and critical items per VAULT-ITEMS; originally "secrets + critical secrets"). Calls, desktop/agent pairing and LEASH, wallet, location and presence come later. |
| D4 | **Minimum Android 12 (API 31)**; target the current API level. |
| D5 | **Message search later** (not in v1). |
| D6 | **Biometric app lock in v1**: opening the app (and returning to it after a timeout) can require a biometric or device credential via BiometricPrompt (class 3), gating a Keystore key that unlocks the app's local data. It is a convenience layer only: it never replaces the vault PIN (unlocking the vault) or the credential password (critical actions). |

## 3. Design language (from Proton Mail)

Reference screenshots are kept privately (they show a real mailbox); the
patterns:

- **Top bar**: menu button, screen title, search, avatar (initial tile).
- **Navigation drawer** as the main navigation (no bottom tabs): primary
  destinations, then Settings / Help, version at the bottom. No "create"
  group (0.1.11, owner decision of 2026-10-07; Proton's Create folder /
  label is not adopted): the floating action button creates.
- **List rows**: rounded-square initial tile, two lines (name, preview),
  date and a trailing action icon; generous spacing.
- **Empty states**: one illustration, a title and one line.
- **Floating controls**: a filter chip bottom-left (e.g. Unread), a primary
  action button bottom-right (compose / add). The floating action button
  is the place to create (0.1.11): on Messages it starts a new message,
  on Connections it invites a connection, on Vault it adds an item.
- **Detail screens**: back arrow, centred title, content in a card, a
  floating pill of actions at the bottom.
- **Settings**: grouped rounded cards, rows with icon + label + chevron,
  section headers.
- **Avatar sheet**: a bottom sheet with the account and its options,
  opened fully expanded and scrolling (0.1.12), **Lock vault** first.
- **VettID brand** (owner, 2026-10-04): gold `#FFC125` (the website's
  `--gold`) as the single accent, `--gold-ink-light` `#7F640A` for gold
  text and icons on light surfaces; navy surfaces from the website tokens;
  Plus Jakarta Sans for headings and Inter for body, as on the website;
  Material Icons Outlined. Connection tiles are one indigo, favourite
  connections teal, the member's own avatar gold.

## 4. Screens (v1)

**Drawer** (0.1.11, owner decisions of 2026-10-07): Messages ·
Connections · Approvals (badge) · Vault · History · Settings · Help —
later: Calls, Devices & agents, Shared actions & introductions, Wallet,
Location. "Credential" is not in the drawer: it is reached from Settings →
Security → Credential. "Invite a connection" is not in the drawer either:
the floating action button invites on Connections and starts a new
message on Messages (§3). The drawer has **no "create" group** (owner
decision of 2026-10-07; 0.1.2 planned one with Invite a connection and
New item): the floating action button creates on every screen that
creates something (§3), so the drawer holds only destinations.

**"Vault", not "Items", in the interface** (0.1.11, owner decision of
2026-10-07). The member's stored data (VAULT-ITEMS) is called **Vault**
in everything the member sees: the drawer label, screen titles ("Vault",
"Vault: Passport" or the item's name), empty states ("Your vault is
empty"), the add button ("Add to vault") and messages. The
specifications, the code (`:feature:items`, `item.*` types, `item_id`)
and this plan's technical text keep **item** as the technical term; the
rows below say "Vault" for the screens and "item" for the data.

| Screen | Proton analogue | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Messages | Inbox | Conversations by connection; Unread chip; the floating action button starts a new message (pick a connection, then the conversation) |
| Conversation | Message detail | Bubbles in a card list; pill actions (reply, more) |
| Connections | Contacts | Initial tiles, status (pending / active / stale / blocked); a star marks favourites (the owner's `favorite` flag, `connection.update`), whose tiles are teal; the floating action button invites a connection (0.1.11: QR or link, or scan the other's QR), the only invite entry point besides empty states. Each is titled "First Last" from the profile's core (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.18.0 §10.8), the display name, if any, as secondary text. Incoming requests show the requester's names the same way. Only between activation and the first `profile.update`, when the request's names are not at hand: "Name not shared yet"; never "Unnamed connection" |
| Connection detail | — | Titled "First Last" (never an alias), the display name secondary. Profile shared with you (the names labelled as the name on their VettID account, never "verified"; display name, photo and items labelled as shared by them), sharing, authenticate, the vault key fingerprint (`ik`, 8 groups of 4 hex digits, §10.8: the lasting identity check). The action bar: message, favourite, History, remove (confirmed). No safety code (it belongs to connecting: the invite and request screens), no alias or notes, no edit or block (0.1.13; blocking stays on an incoming request) |
| Approvals | — (VettID-specific) | Pending connection requests, grant requests, critical-item uses, share-rule decisions; approve/deny; critical items need the credential password |
| Vault | Folder list | Titled "Vault" (0.1.11; was "Items"). Items per VAULT-ITEMS: name, category, typed fields, tags, sensitivity (data / secret / critical); filter by tag; add/edit from templates; share rules by tag (default: ask for each new item). Critical items live in the Protean Credential and are never shared by a rule |
| History | — (VettID-specific) | The member's audit log (0.1.11, `audit.list`, VAULT-MESSAGING 0.20.0 §10.9), read-only: a search field (the vault searches, `q`), filter chips (category, connection, date range), a list of entries newest first with infinite scroll, and an entry detail. Details below |
| Credential | — | Reached from Settings → Security → Credential (0.1.11; not in the drawer). Critical items inside the Protean Credential; unlock window; password change; the vault-held credential copy (the backup) on/off. Turning it off shows VAULT-MESSAGING §3.5.6's warning and needs a confirmation: "If this phone is lost, broken, reset or replaced without a transfer, your vault **cannot be recovered**. It can only be deleted and replaced by a new one, and **everything in it is lost**." While off, the screen and Settings keep a short "no recovery" notice. Turning it on asks for the password at once (an owner check) so that the copy exists, and says recovery is possible from then on |
| Settings | Settings | At the top, an **account card** (0.1.11): the member's first and last name and full email address (`account.get`, VAULT-MESSAGING 0.20.0 §11.13) and the membership state; tapping it opens the avatar sheet. Vault (status, release, lock, PIN); Security (credential, recovery, attestation info, biometric app lock and timeout, the owner-check interval 1–24 h and the hold switch); Privacy (the **Shared profile**, glyph `Badge`, 0.1.12: display name, `@profile` items and the profile photo, **camera only** — "Take a photo" / "Retake photo" opens the app's own camera screen, front camera first with a switch to the rear one, then "Retake" or "Use photo"; no selection of an existing picture and no other camera app; the shot stays in memory, is never saved to the gallery, and is cropped, scaled and re-encoded to a JPEG ≤ 65,536 bytes without EXIF before `profile.set{photo}`; "Remove photo" confirmed; a refused camera permission is explained, with the system settings once Android no longer asks; a phone without a camera is told); App (theme, notifications and push path) |
| Owner check | — (VettID-specific) | One screen: PIN and credential password together (VAULT-MESSAGING §3.6.5); also the "vault held" screen with the waiting counts and the lock action |
| Avatar sheet | Account sheet | The member's first and last name and **full email address** (0.1.11, from `account.get`'s snapshot `first_name`, `last_name` and `email`, VAULT-MESSAGING 0.20.0 §11.13; never the masked hint), the email labelled "Only you see this address" and the names "Your connections see this name"; **Lock vault first** (0.1.12), right under the name and email, before Change name, Shared profile and the email; the sheet scrolls; vault status; **Change name** (0.1.10): the two names (the registration rule: letters, spaces, `'’.-`, ≤ 40), then the owner-check screen's PIN and password, sent as `account.name.set`; then "Name change requested" until `account.get`'s `name_request` is `applied` or `refused`; `too_soon` (from the vault or the member API): "You can change your name once every 30 days. You can change it again on <date>" (VAULT-MESSAGING §10.8), membership and subscription (read-only, from the vault, VAULT-MESSAGING §11.13), open account portal (browser) |
| Recovery (new phone) | — (VettID-specific) | Only with the backup on: scan the portal's recovery QR → claim (`email_hint`) → register → PIN → credential password → the app replaces the old one. No other path: 0.1.6's backup-off choice (new credential or delete) is removed. `no_backup` at register or unlock (a vault whose backup is off): "This vault cannot be recovered: its credential backup was off. Delete it on the account site and start over with a new setup code", with a link to the portal's start-over page (MEMBER-API 2.1.0) and then to onboarding |
| Pending deletion | — | When `GET /api/vault/status` shows `deletion` (a start-over requested on the portal, VAULT-MESSAGING §11.11.9): an urgent banner with the time left and **Cancel deletion** (`POST /api/vault/deletion/cancel {deletion_id}`, signed by the app key, with the `deletion_id` from the status's `deletion: {deletion_id, state, deletes_at}`, MEMBER-API 2.1.1) |
| Transfer (new phone) | — (VettID-specific) | Scan the old phone's transfer QR → compare the SAS → wait for the approval → `device.paired{transfer}`: the app stores its `vault_id` and the member's `user_guid` (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.17.0 §6.7.1) like an enrolled phone, so that it unlocks later with the PIN. Without `user_guid` (a vault release before 0.17.0) the transfer still completes and the app warns: "This phone cannot unlock your vault after it locks until your vault is updated" |
| Onboarding | Sign-in flow | Scan the setup QR from the account portal, or type its short code with the account's email (no sign-in in the app, VAULT-MESSAGING 0.15.0 §11.12) → confirm the account (`email_hint`) → enroll vault (PIN, credential password) → first connection guide |

**History** (0.1.11, owner decision of 2026-10-07). The member's audit
log, as the vault keeps it (VAULT-MESSAGING §10.9), read-only: nothing on
the screen changes or deletes an entry.

- **List.** Rows newest first: an icon and label per kind (from the
  app's string resources; an unknown kind shows the kind itself), the
  connection's "First Last", the device's or the item's name where the
  entry refers to one (resolved from the app's caches; a removed one
  shows "Removed connection" / "Removed device" / "Deleted item"), and
  the time. Infinite scroll: `audit.list` with `limit` 50 and
  `before_seq` = the previous page's `next_before_seq`; no
  `next_before_seq` is the end of the log ("Start of your history"). A
  page with `partial: true` (a search that ran out of its scan budget)
  may hold few or no entries: the app keeps loading with the cursor
  while the list is short of the screen, and shows "Searching older
  entries…" until it has a full page or the end.
- **Search.** A search field in the top bar sends `q` (trimmed, NFC,
  at most 128 bytes; the field stops there) after a 300 ms pause, and
  restarts the list. The vault matches the kind and the current names
  of the connection, device and item (§10.9); the hint text says so:
  "Search by name or event". It does not search the app's own labels,
  which may be translated: searching "unlocked" finds
  `vault.unlocked`, searching a translated label may not.
- **Filters** (chips under the search field, combined with each other
  and with the search):
  - **Category**, one at a time ("All" by default), sent as `kinds`
    prefixes:

    | Category | `kinds` prefixes |
    |---|---|
    | Unlocks and owner checks | `vault`, `owner_check` |
    | Security | `credential`, `identity`, `recovery` |
    | Devices | `device`, `approval` |
    | Connections | `connection`, `intro`, `profile` |
    | Messages and calls | `message`, `call` |
    | Vault (items, sharing, wallet) | `item`, `tag`, `share`, `grant`, `critical-secret`, `wallet` |
    | Agents | `leash`, `action` |
    | Location | `location` |
    | Account and settings | `account`, `settings` |
    | Blocked and dropped | `drop` |

    Every audit kind of §10.9 falls in exactly one category (blocks are
    `connection.blocked` / `.unblocked`, so under Connections). A kind
    a newer vault adds outside these prefixes appears under "All" only.
  - **Connection**: pick one from the connection list; sent as
    `connection_id` (`audit.list`; the connection's detail screen opens
    the same History screen with it preset, using
    `connection.audit.list`).
  - **Date range**: presets (today, last 7 days, last 30 days) and a
    custom range from the date picker, sent as `since` (the start of
    the first day, local time, as RFC 3339 with offset) and `until`
    (the start of the day after the last).
- **Entry detail** (tap a row): the label and kind, the exact time,
  the connection (opens it, if it still exists), the device, the item
  (opens it, if it still exists and is not critical; a critical item
  opens only with the credential password as elsewhere), `direction`,
  `ref` (copyable), `seq` and the entry's `hash`. Nothing in the detail
  is editable.
- **Integrity.** Unfiltered pages chain (`prev` = the next older
  entry's `hash`); the app checks the chain where pages are contiguous
  and keeps its anchor as VAULT-MESSAGING §10.9 says (an
  `after_seq` read from the anchor in the background, never from a
  filtered list). A log that does not extend the anchor shows a red
  banner "Your vault's history does not match what this phone saw
  before" at the top of History and in Settings → Security; filtered and
  searched lists are not chain-checked.
- **States.** Empty log: "No history yet". No results: "Nothing
  matches" with "Clear filters". While held or due (§3.6), History is
  gated like every vault screen.

Every list has an empty state; every destructive action has a confirmation;
every critical action asks for the credential password.

There is no backup or export of vault data out of the service (owner
decision, 2026-10-03); no screen offers one.

## 5. Architecture

Multi-module Gradle, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose + Material3, Hilt, coroutines
and Flow, Room (encrypted with a Keystore-held key) for local caches,
DataStore for preferences, OkHttp for HTTP, strings in resources from day
one (translation-ready), accessibility labels required in review.

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `:core:crypto` | Suite 2 (HPKE MLKEM768X25519 / HKDF-SHA256 / ChaCha20-Poly1305), XChaCha20 sessions, Ed25519, Argon2id; envelope v2; handshake and epochs; credential UTK/reply-key sealing. **Must pass the vettid-vault test vectors byte for byte.** |
| `:core:keystore` | Android Keystore keys (device identity, relay key wrapping, device attestation key with StrongBox/TEE, the biometric-gated app-data key) |
| `:core:attestation` | Ported Nitro attestation + PCR manifest verification; Android key attestation for enrollment/unlock (§11.7) |
| `:core:relay` | Relay client (RELAY-PROTOCOL 0.6): register, signed requests, tokens, deposit, collect (long-poll / WebSocket), ack, claims, blobs |
| `:core:altchan` | Member-API alternate channel: code redeem and recovery claim, requests signed by the app key (no member session), descriptors, sealed enroll/unlock/lock, result polling, release-update approval |
| `:core:vault` | Typed vault client: one function per §10 type, sessions with the vault, dedupe, outbox, sync events → repositories |
| `:core:data` | Repositories and Room caches per feature |
| `:core:ui` | Theme (navy + gold, light/dark), components (top bar, drawer, list row, empty state, pill bar, settings cards, sheets) |
| `:feature:*` | onboarding, messages, connections, approvals, items (the "Vault" screens), credential, settings, history (0.1.11) |
| `:app` | Navigation (type-safe routes), DI wiring, notifications |

Rules: features depend only on `:core:*`; no feature touches transport or
crypto directly; one ViewModel per screen with immutable UI state.

## 6. Phases

| Phase | Contents | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| A0 | Spec + this plan approved; old code tagged and moved off `main`; empty multi-module skeleton, CI (build, unit tests, lint, detekt), theme and component gallery screen | CI green; component gallery matches the design language on a phone |
| A1 | `:core:crypto` + vectors; `:core:keystore`; `:core:attestation` port | All vettid-vault vectors pass (incl. MLKEM768X25519 HPKE interop) |
| A2 | `:core:relay` + `:core:altchan` + `:core:vault` against a local dev stack (vettid-vault integration stack: relay + parent + dev enclave + member-API stand-in) | Instrumented test enrolls, unlocks, exchanges a message with a `vaultctl` peer |
| A3 | Onboarding, unlock, credential, settings screens (with the account card, 0.1.11), biometric app lock; History (0.1.11), once the vault release with VAULT-MESSAGING 0.20.0's search is in staging | Fresh install → enrolled vault with credential on a real phone (dev stack) |
| A4 | Connections, messages, approvals | Invite/QR connect, SAS, messages both ways, approvals |
| A5 | Items (data, secret, critical), tags, share rules, grants and critical-item approvals | Flows against the dev stack and a second vault |
| A6 | Hardening and polish: accessibility pass, notifications, offline behaviour, error states, Play pre-launch report | Internal testing track build |

Calls, devices/agents/LEASH, wallet, location and presence follow v1 in
that order, each as its own phase.

**Owner check** (VAULT-MESSAGING 0.13.0 §3.6, owner decisions of
2026-10-05). The vault holds when the member has not given the PIN and
the credential password together for 24 h (or the member's shorter
interval). Follow-ups, in A3 unless noted:

1. `:core:vault`: `vault.owner-check` (UTK-sealed `{pin, password}` with
   the blob; the new blob is stored and acked like any credential
   response), `vault.held`, `owner_check` in `vault.status`,
   `owner_check_required`, `vault.locking{reason: "owner_check"}`,
   `sync.event{owner_check}`, the `owner_check.*` feed kinds.
2. **One check screen**: PIN and password on one screen, sent together;
   both zeroized after the answer. Shows which entry was wrong, the
   checks left before the lock (10 − `failures`) and a running backoff,
   counted down from the `backoff` error's `retry_after` (VAULT-MESSAGING
   0.17.0 §10.1); the send button stays off until it ends.
3. **When to ask**: at the first app open or return to the foreground
   after the deadline, before any vault screen; never over an action in
   progress. A refused request keeps its input (drafts stay drafts) and
   the prompt follows when the member leaves the screen.
4. **Held screen**: no cached vault content (messages, items,
   connections, feed) while held; only the check, the `vault.held`
   counts ("3 new messages waiting") and the lock action. After the
   check, catch up (`sync.since`, `feed.list`, `message.list`).
5. **Early warning** (A6, with notifications): from 1 h before the
   deadline, a banner and a local notification with "check now".
6. **Locked and past the deadline**: one screen for PIN and password;
   unlock, read `vault.status`, then send the check without asking again.
7. **Settings**: the interval (1–24 h); shortening may hold the vault at
   once, so the app offers a check with the change.
   **Hold switch** (owner decision of 2026-10-06, §3.6.7): turning the
   hold off is part of a check (the same PIN-and-password screen, with
   `hold: false` and an optional end date up to 30 days ahead in the
   sealed payload) and comes with a plain warning of what it gives up;
   turning it on is a plain `settings.set`. While off: a persistent
   "hold is off" indicator (with the end date) on the main screens. The
   check is never dismissible: past the deadline the vault gates the app
   (`vault.status` `state: "due"`) exactly as when held, so the same
   check screen comes first; only desktops, agents, calls (which may
   ring, but the app answers only after the check) and presence keep
   running. Show `owner_check.hold_changed` feed items.
8. **Lock after ten failures**: show the locked state and the urgent
   feed item after the next unlock.
9. Tests: an injectable clock in the dev stack (vettid-vault) to drive a
   vault past its deadline; instrumented tests for the held screen, the
   check, a wrong PIN, a wrong password and the ten-failure lock.

**Location phase notes** (from vettid-dev `docs/plans/location-sharing-ux.md`,
input for when the location batch is specified in VAULT-MESSAGING): show a
shared location in three layers: an event when a connection **starts
sharing** with you (a feed item, once), a **glance** on the connection's row
(last-seen place and age), and **detail** on the connection screen (map with
accuracy and time). The viewer shows the latest location the vault cached
for that connection rather than tracking live, and offers a **request
location** action that asks the connection to share once. The vault
schema for the cache and the request verb belong to the location batch.

## 7. Dependencies on other work

- **Running vault**: v1 development uses the local dev stack; real devices
  need the V5 deployment (release pipeline, member API vault routes
  deployed, enrollment/recovery portal pages).
- **Push** (owner decision, 2026-10-03: both paths): FCM when Google Play
  services are present, **UnifiedPush** for phones without them (for
  example GrapheneOS), and, with neither, a foreground service that keeps
  the relay connection, or periodic polling (PUSH-GATEWAY 0.2.0 §11). The
  member can pick the path in notification settings. Until the gateway is
  deployed (FCM needs credentials), v1 collects while the app is open and
  through the foreground-service path.
- **Membership**: enrollment requires an account.vettid.org member who has
  accepted the current terms; the portal checks it when it issues the
  setup code (MEMBER-API 2.0.0). The app itself never signs in.

## 8. Risks

1. **Post-quantum crypto on Android**: Android has no platform ML-KEM; the
   suite needs BouncyCastle (or another library) supporting HPKE with
   MLKEM768X25519 (codepoint 0x647a) — the cross-implementation vectors are
   an open follow-up in VAULT-MESSAGING §15. Verify early (A1); fall back to
   a small audited implementation only if no library fits.
2. **Scope creep from the old app**: v1 is deliberately small; resist
   porting screens without a v1 need.
3. **Device attestation in the field**: key attestation varies by vendor;
   test on several devices before release.
4. **Background delivery without push**: until the gateway exists,
   messages arrive while the app is open or through the foreground
   service; set expectations in the UI.
5. **GrapheneOS and device attestation** (resolved): GrapheneOS reports
   its own verified-boot key (`SelfSigned`); VAULT-MESSAGING 0.9.0 §11.7
   accepts it when the key is one of the pinned GrapheneOS fingerprints.
   Staging accepted GrapheneOS attestation on real phones on 2026-10-05
   (Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, verified boot yellow / `SelfSigned`).

## 9. Open questions

None at this time (min SDK, search and biometrics decided 2026-10-03).
